## Installation

### Theme

The theme is based on the wonderfully made [oskarkrawczyk](https://github.com/oskarkrawczyk/honukai-iterm-zsh) theme.

1. Drop [`yinwoods.zsh-theme`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yinwoods/honukai-iterm/master/yinwoods.zsh-theme) into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory
2. Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="yinwoods"` in `~/.zshrc`
3. Reload ZSH with `source ~/.zshrc`

### Colors

1. Open **Preferences** pane on the **Profiles** tab in iTerm
2. Switch to the **Colors** tab and import the [`yinwoods.itermcolors`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yinwoods/honukai-iterm/master/yinwoods.itermcolors) (drop-down in the lower right corner)

**NOTE**: You'll need at least iTerm2.9-nightly (aka 3.0)

### Extra eye-candy

There's a bunch of settings you might want to change in your profile in order to get the extra eye-candy.

#### **Text** tab:

**Cursor**

- Set to **Underline**

**Font**

- Change to **[12pt Fira Mono Medium](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira/tree/master/ttf)** (I personally love the Fira font-face, and highly suggest using it)

**Text Rendering**

- Disable **Draw bold in bold font**
- Disable **Draw bold in bright colors**
- Enable **Draw anti-aliased text with thin strokes**

#### **Window** tab

**Window appearance**
